# 👋 Hi, I'm Gaurang B

🚀 I'm a technology enthusiast, problem solver, and out-of-the-box thinker. I thrive on automating everyday tasks and crafting solutions that make life easier. When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring the outdoors, capturing moments through my lens, or practicing my faith as a devout Hindu.
